# Flask Website

A simple and elegant Flask-based web application template.

## 🚀 Features

- Lightweight structure: built with Flask and Jinja2
- Modular design for easy customization and extension
- Clean templates and static file organization
- Configurable environment (development & production)
- Ready for integration with databases, APIs, authentication, and more

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip (or `venv` for virtual environments)

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/invectus-dev/flask-website.git
   cd flask-website

2. Create and activate a virtual environment

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac  
   venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Copy the example environment file and customize your settings:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` to adjust:

* `FLASK_APP` – entry point, e.g. `app.py`
* `FLASK_ENV` – `development` or `production`
* Optional API keys, database URIs, or app-specific options

## 🚧 Running the App

Start the development server:

```bash
flask run
```

Then open [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000) in your browser.

For production deployments, consider using **Gunicorn** or **uWSGI** behind **NGINX**.

## 🔄 Project Structure

```
flask-website/
├── app.py             # Application entry point
├── requirements.txt   # Python dependencies
├── .env.example       # Template for environment config
├── templates/         # Jinja2 HTML templates
└── static/            # CSS, JS, images, etc.
```

* `app.py` contains Flask routes and core logic.
* `templates/` and `static/` include the UI layer and assets.
* Organize additional modules or blueprints as your project grows.

## 📈 Extending the Application

1. **Database integration**
   Add Flask extensions (e.g., `Flask-SQLAlchemy`, `Flask-Migrate`) and configure in `app.py`.

2. **User authentication**
   Integrate `Flask-Login`, `Flask-Dance`, or JWT-based access control.

3. **API consumption**
   Use `requests` or similar to fetch external data (news, products, APIs).

4. **Background tasks**
   Use `Celery`, `RQ`, or Python threads for asynchronous processing.

## ✅ Testing

* (Optional) Add test suite using `pytest` or `unittest`
* Run tests with:

  ```bash
  pytest
  ```

### 📝 Next steps

- Replace `app.py` reference with your actual entry file if named differently.
- Expand “Features” and “Extending” sections with project-specific details (e.g., news fetching, API usage).
- Add badges (e.g. build status, license, code coverage) at the top for improved visibility.
- Provide a `.env.example` that highlights necessary variables.
- Include screenshots or animated GIFs if your app has a UI portion.
